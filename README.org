* PHP Database Hook
  Tired of not being able to get into a shared host's database? Don't have
  PHPMyAdmin or shell access? Upload this one script to gain access.
* Usage
  Change connection string to match your database settings. 

  (Possibly grab the settings from other installed software on the host,
  Wordpress, Drupal, Joomla, etc etc. Look for config.php or settings.php files)

  Upload script.

  Navigate in your browser to where you uploaded the script.

  Enter SQL and get a table of results.

* WARNINGS
  
  This is obviously a complete security hole. Delete the script when you are
  done.

  There is no checking of the SQL you enter, or warnings. Use at your own risk.
